## Issue Summary:
1. Duration: 2 hours (Start: 2023-11-15 9:00 AM, End: 2023-11-15 11:00 PM)
2. Impact: Website downtime, users experienced HTTP 503 errors, and 50% of users were affected.
3. Root Cause: Misconfigured Nginx server led to inefficient request handling, causing performance degradation.
## Timeline:

- 9:00 AM UTC: Monitoring alert triggered due to increased server response times.
- 9:05 AM UTC: Engineers began investigating logs and metrics to identify the root cause.
- 9:20 AM UTC: The initial assumption of high server load led to exploring database issues, but no correlation was found.
- 9:35 AM UTC: Suspected a potential DDoS attack due to the sudden traffic spike; escalated the incident to the DevOps team.
- 10:00 AM UTC: The DevOps team identified a misconfigured Nginx server as the root cause of the performance degradation.
- 10:15 AM UTC: Optimized Nginx configuration to efficiently handle incoming requests.
- 10:30 AM UTC: Restarted the Nginx service to apply the configuration changes.
- 11:00 PM UTC: Web service restored; HTTP 200 responses confirmed; monitoring indicated normalized server response times.
## Root Cause and Resolution:

### Root Cause:
The Nginx server misconfiguration resulted in inefficient request handling, leading to increased server load.
### Resolution:
1. Optimized Nginx configuration to enhance request processing efficiency.
2. Applied the configuration changes and restarted the Nginx service.

### Improvements/Fixes:
1. Establish a regular schedule for proactive Nginx configuration reviews.
2. Enhance monitoring thresholds for early detection of abnormal server behavior.
## Tasks:
1. Implement automated testing for critical website functionalities during routine maintenance.
2. Conduct a comprehensive audit of server configurations to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
